It includes new features such as login, get today's card ... etc.  
if you want to install this version of `dcard.js`
```sh

A simple Dcard API wrapper for NodeJS.  
dcard.js helps you retrieve data of posts from Dcard easily.  
`dcard.js` is **alpha** for now.

Sorry for inconvenience.

Install
==
![npm info](https://nodei.co/npm/dcard.png?downloads=true)  

```
$ npm install --save dcard@next
```

Usage
==
### Import
Import the method you need or import the whole package.
```js
// es6 (recommended)
import { getAllForum, getTodayDcard } from 'dcard';
// or import them all
import Dcard from 'dcard';
Dcard.getAllForum();

// es5
var Dcard = require('dcard');
Dcard.getAllForum();
```

### Return Value
All the methods will return a es6 **Promise**,
 use promise specific function to get your asynchronous response. See each method for more information.

```js
import { getAllForum } from 'dcard';

getAllForum()
    .then(response => {
        console.log(response);
    });
```

### `DcardClient`:
A class that you can create a new `DcardClient` for authentication usage. There is also a default client named `defaultClient` which is used in every authentication api calls when client is not specified.
```js
import { DcardClient } from 'dcard';

const dc = new DcardClient();

const newClientOptions = {
    auth: true,
    client: dc
};
```

### Authentication
All methods has two optional arguments: `auth` and `client`. When the api call is required for authentication, `auth` will be set to `true` and `client` will be set to `defaultClient`. Otherwise `auth` will be `false` and `client` will not have any usage.

You can always change the two arguments in any methods whenever you like, when `auth` is set to `true`, it will simply wrap any `fetch` call inside the function to pass the cookie data. Passing another client will give you another `fetch` client with independent cookie data.

You should be note that because of the security issue, all the authentication methods will not worked in browser environment. That is, when `auth` is set to true, the function will only work in server side (node.js) environment.
